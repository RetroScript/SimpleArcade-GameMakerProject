CREATING A RANDOM ENEMY GENERATOR

[04/11/23]: PLANNING A RANDOM ENEMY SPAWN SYSTEM

Hello again, now I want the enemies to randomly generate within the map in a way that it
spawns around and far from the player in a way to have enough time to kill them making
the gameplay more fair.

To this I'm going to use the random() and the random_range() functions.

And I also have to implement a cooldown variable such as a spawn_limit variable.

RANDOMLY SPAWNING THE ENEMIES ON THE ROOM

1-take random positions>>
2-check if the position are into the desired coordinates>>
3-if so, spawn the enemies, spawning cooldown counts>>
4-count each spawn, if it hits the limit wait to the player kill all of them
