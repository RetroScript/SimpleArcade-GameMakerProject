CREATING A SHOOTING SYSTEM

[30/10/23]: today i'll try to implement a simple shooting system in which the player will
be able to collect a gun and take shoots with it.

the first ideia is to detect when the player collides with the dropped gun and then
make it get out of the floor and follow him.

so we have this simple algoritm:

1 - player and gun colides >> 
2 - gun is destroyed >> 
3 - new gun with new states is created >>
4 - the new gun follows the player 

FIRST PROBLEM

not knowing how to create a new instace above a previous one, even using the needed
method with the desired properties:

instance_create_layer(oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y, "Instances", oWeapon)

I can't realize where I can set the new gun layer position in relation to the player

SOLUTION FOUND 

there are two possible solutions to this problem, the first is creating a new instance
layer and putting the new guns in there, and the second is by using the depth property of 
a single layer with the two objects, object and player, and putting the new gun instance
at a more "close" position.

So now we have these pieces of code:

instance_create_layer(oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y, "Instances_1", oWeapon)
instance_create_depth(oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y, 0, oWeapon)

SOLUTION CHO SEN --> the second one --> instance_create_depth(oPlayer.x, oPlayer.y, 0, oWeapon)

CONCLUSION - WHAT DID I LEARN TODAY?

1 - how to destroy instances
2 - how to create instances...
	2.1 - in different layers
	2.2 - in different depths
3 - the layers types and it's properties
