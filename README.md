# SimpleArcade-GameMakerProject
 A simple arcade project that involves GML and devlogs experience.

 ## Main Goal

 My main objective with this code is to make a game from the start to finish documentating all the process involved with the development, besides by also encorauging me to try new things such as new techniques and good practices in the programming world. Also, with this project, I intend to play with `git` and `gitHub` a lot in order to get used to it's features and functions.

 ## DevLogs

 The devlogs can be considered the most important part of the process. It will guide the viewers and the followers through the conceptual and logical flow of the ideias in a pratical way. The main ideia is not to make it hard to follow, just like an friendly talk between BFF's.

 ### Where do I find the DevLogs documentation?

 You can check the files anytime into the `notes` folder, iside of it you wil be able to see subfolders with proper names in reference to diferent parts of the development related to the game project.
